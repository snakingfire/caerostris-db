## STATUS — T+00:01 (GREEN — setup phase)

**Level:** GREEN
**Wallclock:** 2026-06-13T18:25:30Z (T+00:01)
**Phase:** Setup / first epoch — T+0:20 checkpoint is still 19 min away.
**Expected score:** n/a (no rubric report exists yet; first grader cycle not yet run)
**Actual score:** 0 (no code, no proofs, no TCK pass-rate — board is at scaffold state)
**Assessment:** On pace for the setup phase. No work has landed yet; bootstrap sentinel
  `.project/.bootstrapped` is absent. Board has 7 READY tasks and 3 READY SPIKEs —
  all unclaimed, zero in-progress, zero in-review. The S3 mock environment and the
  Epoch 1 mainspring dispatch are the immediate priorities.
**Action:** Dispatching Epoch 1 wave below. No alarm needed; flag for re-check at T+0:20.
